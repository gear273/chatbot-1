## Introduction

The Chatbot project showcases how to build and deploy a chatbot using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. It provides a conversational interface for interacting with users and processing their queries.

## Technologies

The following technologies are used in this project:

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries
- Machine Learning Libraries
- Langchain


## Features

This chatbot project includes the following features:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizes NLP techniques to understand user queries and extract meaningful information.
- **Intent Recognition**: Implements machine learning algorithms to recognize the intent behind user queries.
- **Contextual Dialog**: Maintains context during a conversation to provide relevant responses.
- **Customization**: Allows customization of the chatbot behavior and responses based on specific requirements.


## Getting Started
